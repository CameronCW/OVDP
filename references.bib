The effects of damage, wear, and contamination may be compensated, in many cases, through image processing and analysis methods. The speed and data handling capacity of available computing hardware make this approach practical. Various aspects of this approach are discussed. A feasibility test is reported which used a general purpose optical metrology system to study a 50 year old 78 r.p.m. phonograph record. Comparisons are presented with stylus playback of the record and with a digitally remastered version of the original magnetic recording. A more extensive implementation of this approach, with dedicated hardware and software, is considered.},

	abstract = {The optical retrieval and storage technique called VisualAudio provides a way to extract sound information from a phonographic record without any mechanical contact. The process is straightforward: we take a picture of each side of the disk using a dedicated analog camera, we store the film as our working copy, and when needed, we scan the film and process the image in order to extract the sound. This technique can be used to retrieve the sound of older records that are in such a bad shape that no regular turntable can be used. A working prototype has been built and was used to retrieve the sound from several records. A new prototype is currently being designed and built that will significantly improve the quality of the extracted sound. In this paper, we describe the principles and the characteristics of the different parts of the system and we analyze the performances. We hope that the new prototype will be used to save the sound from numerous old records.},

	abstract = {Audio bandwidth extension involves the realistic reconstruction of high-frequency spectra from bandlimited observations. In cases where the lowpass degradation is unknown, such as in restoring historical audio recordings, this becomes a blind problem. This paper introduces a novel method called BABE (Blind Audio Bandwidth Extension) that addresses the blind problem in a zero-shot setting, leveraging the generative priors of a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model. During the inference process, BABE utilizes a generalized version of diffusion posterior sampling, where the degradation operator is unknown but parametrized and inferred iteratively. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using objective and subjective metrics, and the results show that BABE surpasses state-of-the-art blind bandwidth extension baselines and achieves competitive performance compared to informed methods when tested with synthetic data. Moreover, BABE exhibits robust generalization capabilities when enhancing real historical recordings, effectively reconstructing the missing high-frequency content while maintaining coherence with the original recording. Subjective preference tests confirm that BABE significantly improves the audio quality of historical music recordings. Examples of historical recordings restored with the proposed method are available on the companion webpage: (http://research.spa.aalto.fi/publications/papers/ieee-taslp-babe/)},

	title = {Phonographic record sound extraction by image processing},
	abstract = {The phonographic record was the only way to store sounds until the introduction of magnetic tape in the early 50’s. Therefore there are huge collections of phonographic records, for example in radio stations and national sound archives. Such archives include pressed discs, which were produced in mass by record companies for commercial distribution, as well as direct cut discs obtained by the direct recording with often a great cultural value and available only as single copies. Many records are deteriorating with time. Worse, many records are in an advanced stage of decay and would be destroyed by the movement of the stylus from even the best turntables. Thus, we risk loosing an important cultural heritage, if no alternative playback system is developed. In record players, a needle follows the position of the groove and converts it into an electrical signal corresponding to the sound. This means that the radial displacement of the groove contains the sound information. Thus the sound information is visible and it is then possible to extract it by image processing techniques. These observations lead to the VisualAudio project, which proposes an optical system to extract the sound from phonographic records. The VisualAudio concept proposes first to take the record in picture, in order to have a photographic copy of the record and of the sound. This photographic sound copy can be stored for long term archiving. Then the film is digitized using a specially designed rotating scanner, and the image is processed in order to extract the recorded sound. Thus this system can play records without deteriorating them and it is also able to play severely damaged records. This work focuses on the image processing parts of the VisualAudio project. The image acquisition system is thoroughly studied to understand the image formation process as well as all kinds of degradations, which may affect the final sound quality. Based on this analysis, a groove model is proposed, in order to develop dedicated image extraction and signal correction methods. The whole system is then evaluated to point out the strengths and weaknesses of the VisualAudio sound extraction process.},

A two-stage U-Net model architecture is designed to model and suppress the degradations with high fidelity. The method processes the time-frequency representation of audio, and is trained using realistic noisy data to jointly remove hiss, clicks, thumps, and other common additive disturbances from old analog discs. The proposed model outperforms previous methods in both objective and subjective metrics. The results of a formal blind listening test show that real gramophone recordings denoised with this method have significantly better quality than the baseline methods.

	abstract = {This thesis proposes a model of creative activity on the computer incorporating the elements of programming, graphics, sound generation, and physical interaction. An interface for manipulating these elements is suggested, based on the concept of a disk-jockey turntable as a performance instrument. A system is developed around this idea, enabling optical pickup of visual information from physical media as input to processes on the computer. Software architecture(s) are discussed and examples are implemented, illustrating the potential uses of the interface for the purpose of creative expression in the virtual domain.},

	abstract = {Audio information stored in the undulations of grooves in a medium such as a phonograph record may be reconstructed, with no or minimal contact, by measuring the groove shape using precision metrology methods and digital image processing. The effects of damage, wear, and contamination may be compensated, in many cases, through image processing and analysis methods. The speed and data handling capacity of available computing hardware make this approach practical. Various aspects of this approach are discussed. A feasibility test is reported which used a general purpose optical metrology system to study a 50 year old 78 r.p.m. phonograph record. Comparisons are presented with stylus playback of the record and with a digitally remastered version of the original magnetic recording. A more extensive implementation of this approach, with dedicated hardware and software, is considered.},

	abstract = {Our work focuses on optically reconstructing the stereo audio signal of a 33 rpm long-playing (LP) record using a white-light interferometry-based approach. Previously, a theoretical framework was presented, alongside the primitive reconstruction result from a few cycles of a stereo sinusoidal test signal. To reconstruct an audible duration of a longer stereo signal requires tackling new problems, such as disc warping, image alignment, and eliminating the effects of noise and broken grooves. This paper proposes solutions to these problems, and presents the complete workflow of our Optical Audio Recon- struction (OAR) system.},
